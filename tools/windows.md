# Windows tools -- Roll Your Own Toolchain

## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
We strongly recommend that you are using a 64-bit Windows 10 and higher. That way you can in most cases avoid the virtual machine and run native Linux command-line tools directly on Windows. This means you can use your own Windows files and don't have to bother transferring files to a virtual machine.

To install Windows Subsystem for Linux, [click here for Microsoft's own instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

There are a number of considerations to keep in mind when using WSL. You now have a Linux file system on your Windows computer, and thus you will have to learn a good deal about Linux to proceed. Here are a few resources, that might be good to look at:
1. [Frequently Asked Questions about Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)
2. [Working across Windows and Linux file systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)
3. [The Linux Command line](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)

After this you should look at the [Linux manual](linux.md).
